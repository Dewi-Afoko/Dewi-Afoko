# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Dewi Afoko!  
💻 **Software Engineer (Backend/Full Stack)**  
🌍 **Based in London, UK**

## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a junior software engineer with a background that’s a bit all over the place—**digital content, customer service, security**—but that just means I’m good at adapting... Right?  

I started coding through **self-teaching**, then levelled up at **Makers Academy**, where I got hands-on with **Python, JavaScript, Flask, React, and databases**. I love building things that solve problems, whether that’s **automating tasks, integrating APIs, or making life a little easier with a web app**.  

Right now, I’m getting stuck into **Django** by rebuilding my **HyPrOps workout tracker**—because why not make things harder for myself? TDD can't save you from deciding to pivot to a different framework!

Always open to **collaborating on something interesting**, so if you’ve got an idea - gimme a shout!

## 💼 Projects  

### 🏋🏽‍♂️ [HyPrOps-Workout-Tracker](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/HyPrOps-Workout-Tracker)  
A **full-stack workout tracker** that lets users plan, log, and tweak their workouts. Originally built with Flask, but I’m now migrating it to **Django** because I enjoy making more work for myself. Eventually I'll get to the other features I want to implement, but for now, it works and I've got a small group of people using it!...

🛠 **Tech:** Python, Flask (soon Django), React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MongoDB  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- Customisable workout tracking  
- Authentication & user profiles, including weight data (and log)
- API integration for exercise data  

---

### 🌦️ [WeatherOrNot](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/WeatherOrNot)  
A **workout generator** that tailors exercise recommendations based on **user preferences + real-time weather data**. Built as a group project, where we all worked **across the whole stack**.  

🛠 **Tech:** JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- Secure signup & login  
- Tracks weight & workout progress  
- Recommends ~workouts~ whether to go outside or not based on **actual weather conditions**  
- Data visualisation tools (progress charts, etc.)  

🎥 **Demo & team workflow overview:** [Watch here](https://youtu.be/Py8htEAksEc?si=mLWIDyz_ex1mfTYL&t=2187)

### 🌐 [acebook-MERNie-Sanders](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/acebook-MERNie-Sanders)  
A **Facebook-style social media app** built with the MERN stack. Great for posting, commenting, and arguing with strangers (but only if we’d finished implementing that feature).  

🛠 **Tech:** React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- User signup/login  
- Post, edit, and delete content  
- Commenting & engagement features

A **mobile guessing game** built with Kotlin and Android Studio. Originally just a **"Guess the Number"** game, but we pivoted to include **city guessing with vague clues**—because why not?  

🛠 **Tech:** Kotlin, Android Studio  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- Multiple difficulty levels  
- Hints system  
- Two game modes (numbers & cities)

🛠 **Tech:** Python, Flask, PostgreSQL  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- User authentication  
- Property listings & booking system  
- Calendar integration
