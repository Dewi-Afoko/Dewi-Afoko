- 👋 Hi, I’m Dewi Afoko!
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much all things geeky! Computers, gaming, learning random new things for fun, politics, philosophy and puroresu!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code!... Although hopefully this repository demonstrates that I have _some_ skills already. Very confident in Python and using SQL/NoSQL databases, trying to refine my frontend skills and bring them to the same level. Thoroughly enjoy using Kotlin and am trying to implement more Android frontends to my projects – as well as continuing to improve my Javascript/React/HTML/CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects where I might be useful!
- 📫 How to reach me on here is probably your best bet!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm unreasonably tall.
