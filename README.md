# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Dewi Afoko!  
💻 **Software Engineer (Backend/Full Stack)**  
🌍 **Based in London, UK**  

---

## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a software engineer who pivoted into tech from a **very non-linear career path**—digital content, customer service, security—you name it. Turns out, coding is the perfect mix of **problem-solving, creativity, and making machines do the hard work for you**, so here I am.  

I got started by **teaching myself Python**, then solidified my skills at **Makers Academy**, working across **Python, JavaScript, Flask, React, Express, and Node.js**, with both **SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases**.  

🔧 **What I’m Building Right Now:**   
I originally built **HyPrOps**, a workout tracker, in **Flask + MongoDB**. Now, I’m rebuilding it from the ground up as **Gains Trust Unchained** using **Django + PostgreSQL + React**, because apparently, I enjoy giving myself extra work.  

My focus is on **backend-heavy development**, building **scalable, well-structured APIs** and **clean, modular systems**, but I’m also levelling up my frontend engineering to create something that looks as good as it functions.  

Always open to **collaborating on something interesting**, so if you’ve got an idea—gimme a shout!

## 💼 Projects  

### 🏋🏽‍♂️ [HyPrOps (v1 - Flask Edition)](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/HyPrOps-Workout-Tracker)  
🚀 **The original workout tracker** that started everything. Built in Flask with a **MongoDB backend**, this was my first real full-stack project.  

🛠 **Tech:** Python, Flask, React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MongoDB  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- 🏋🏽‍♂️ **Customizable workout tracking**  
- 🔐 **Authentication & user profiles, including weight tracking**  
- 📊 **Exercise history & progress tracking**  

👀 **Why I moved on to v2:**  
- MongoDB worked well but wasn’t ideal for **relational data**.  
- The Flask backend was solid but lacked **robust API structuring**.  
- I wanted a **more scalable, modular, and maintainable system.**

### ⛓️‍💥 [Gains Trust Unchained (v2 - Django Edition)](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/Gains_Trust_Unchained)
🚀 **The next-gen version of HyPrOps.** This is where I’m applying everything I’ve learned about **Django, RESTful API design, PostgreSQL, and frontend structuring** to create a highly modular, scalable fitness tracker.  

🛠 **Tech:** Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, React, TailwindCSS  
📌 **Key Features (Completed & Planned):**  
- ✅ **Fully refactored backend using DRF ViewSets & modular API calls**  
- 🏋🏽‍♂️ **Workout creation, editing, and real-time tracking with LiveTracking mode**  
- ⏳ **Automated rest timers & set completion tracking**  
- 📊 **(Coming Soon) Advanced data analysis for progress tracking**  
- 📖 **(Planned) Exercise database with instructions & recommendations**  

🔎 **Latest & Best Code:**
- ✅ **Backend Refactor Complete** → [`refactoring/ViewSets`](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/Gains_Trust_Unchained/tree/refactoring/ViewSets)

### 🌦️ [WeatherOrNot](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/WeatherOrNot)  
A **workout generator** that tailors exercise recommendations based on **user preferences + real-time weather data**. Built as a **group project**, where I worked across **backend, frontend, and deployment**.  

🛠 **Tech:** JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- 🔐 **Secure signup & authentication**  
- 💪🏽 **Tracks weight & workout progress**  
- 🌤 **Recommends workouts based on actual weather conditions**  
- 📊 **Progress tracking & data visualization**

### 🎮 [Guess the Number (or City) Game](https://github.com/Dewi-Afoko/guess-the-number-and-city)  
A **mobile guessing game** built with Kotlin and Android Studio. Started as **"Guess the Number"**, then we pivoted to **guessing cities with vague clues**, because why not?  

🛠 **Tech:** Kotlin, Android Studio  
📌 **Key Features:**  
- 🔢 **Multiple difficulty levels**  
- 🏙 **City guessing mode with hints**
